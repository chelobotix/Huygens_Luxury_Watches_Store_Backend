Patek Philippe's origins date back to 1839 and two watchmakers, Antoine Norbert de Patek and Jean Adrian Philippe.

Due to their innovative and spectacular designs, Jacob and Co have become one of the most recognized luxury brands in the timepiece and jewelry industry.\nThe story behind this brand epitomizes what we call the 'American dream.' Jacob and his family immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan (USSR) in search of a better life. Jacob graduated from a jewelry design course in 1981 and opened a small jewelry booth in New York City's bustling diamond district.

Rolex;It would take a book, and maybe even multiple books, to sum up, Rolex. This Swiss watch brand, founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf, has been the most recognized watch name around the world for decades. The brand created the first water-resistant watch in the early 1920s, which it later named the Oyster, and went on to unveil many firsts in the watch world. It is regularly the partner of choice for explorers, adventurers, and divers, and has set world records. Rolex is best known for its Oyster Perpetual collection, the Cosmograph Daytona, and the Sea- and Sky-Dweller watches.;No watch brand is less in need of an introduction than Rolex. Founded in 1905, Rolex is the brainchild of Hans Wilsdorf, who had the vision to see a watch worn on the wrist. At the time, wristwatches were not very precise nor very common. To convince his customers that a wristwatch could be reliable, he equipped his watches with tiny, extremely precise movements manufactured in Switzerland.\nPrecision and the quality of his wristwatches were of utmost importance to Wilsdorf. His relentless pursuit of chronometric precision quickly led to success. In 1910, a Rolex watch became the first wristwatch to receive the Swiss Certificate of Chronometric Precision. By 1914 Rolex had also scooped up the class “A” precision certificate, a recognition that had previously only been bestowed upon marine chronometers. Rolex moved to Geneva in 1919, and the brand Montres Rolex S.A. was registered in 1920.\nThe Rolex Oyster watch was launched in 1926 and was the first-ever waterproof and dustproof wristwatch. It featured a hermetically sealed case, which was a revolution in the watch industry at the time. Rolex was the first to put it on the wrist of, as we know them today, influencers. A young swimmer Mercedes Gleitze swam across the English Channel wearing a Rolex Oyster. After over 10 hours in the water, the watch remained in perfect working order. Upon her success, Rolex took out a full-page ad in the Daily Mail touting her and their achievement, marking the birth of the testimonial ad.\nRolex came up with an ingenious way to test their watches while at the same time ensuring a global showcase. Following the success of the Mercedes Gleitze swim across the English Channel, they equipped the first expedition to fly over Everest with Rolex Oysters. A full-page ad was also dedicated to the success of the team's mission and the team's satisfaction with the performance of their Rolex wristwatches. A Rolex watch was on Sir Malcolm Campbell's wrist, one of the fastest drivers in the world, when he achieved a speed of over 300 miles per hour in 1935.\nIn 1931 Rolex invented the world's first automatic, or as it is also known, self-winding movement. By incorporating a perpetual rotor, the watch could wind itself with the movement of the wrist. A real watchmaking breakthrough that is at the heart of every modern automatic watch movement today.\nIn the early 1950s, Rolex evolved to manufacturing watches for professionals or tool watches as they are known today, which does more than just telling the time. The watches were for professional activities like mountaineering, scuba diving, scientific expeditions, and aviation.\nRolex has been about precision since its launch in 1905. So much so that in 2015 they redefined their Superlative Chronometer certification to surpass the current watchmaking norms and standards. All Rolex watches come with the certification and a five-year international guarantee.;Rolex/logo.svg
Audemars Piguet;Easily one of the most venerable watch brands on the market today, Swiss brand Audemars Piguet is one of the few privately owned brands - giving it the ability to regularly push the creative envelope. A “Holy Grail” brand for watch collectors, Audemars Piguet's pillar collections include the legendary Royal Oak (first designed by the famed Gerald Genta), Royal Oak Offshore, Code 11:59, and Millenary.;In 1875, Jules Louis Audemars (1851-1918) and Edward Auguste Piguet (1853-1919), both from watchmaking families, set up their business in Le Brassus, Switzerland. They started by producing and selling complicated watch movements to Geneva-based companies but soon expanded to producing watches themselves. They assembled a highly specialized workforce with the necessary skills all under one roof.\nWhen industrial machinery appeared, the two men decided to forego large-volume production and stick with producing one-off complicated watches. They specialized in chiming mechanisms, chronographs, and astronomical indications, which are still manufactured by Audemars Piguet today. Between 1892, when the first minute repeater wristwatch was sold, and 1965, a total of 550 complicated wristwatches were produced, which are highly sought after by collectors today.\nToday, Audemars Piguet employs over 1'450 people worldwide and produces 51'000 watches per year.;Rolex/logo.svg
Rado;Founded in 1917 in Legnau, Switzerland (and originally begun as Schlup & Co.), Rado has always been a cutting-edge Avant-Garde brand. It began using the Rado name in 1957, and over the years, the brand has experimented with many different materials for its watches. Rado was the first to introduce a “scratch-proof”  watch, the DiaStar 1, in 1962 that took the world by storm.  In the ensuing decades, it introduced colored versions of the DiaStar, and by the mid-1980s became the first watch brand to create high-tech ceramic bracelet watches.  Since then, the “master of materials” has regularly surprised and delighted watch lovers with sophisticated metals, bold colors, and contemporary aesthetics.;Brothers Fritz, Ernst, and Werner founded the Schlup & Co. watchmaking factory in 1917 in a converted area of their parents’ house. This humble workshop would later become what we know today as Rado. Even though they started very modestly, by the end of World War II, the factory was among the world’s largest producers of watch movements.\nIt was only in the 1950s that Schlup & Co. started selling watches under the Rado brand name. The iconic Golden Horse collection made its première in 1957, and the Green Horse collection followed in 1958. At the end of the decade, Rado was a truly international brand present in over 61 countries.;Rado/logo.svg
Richard Mille;True adventurers and watch enthusiasts can’t get enough of luxury watch brand Richard Mille, founded by Richard Mille in 2001 with the concept of creating ultra-high-end high-tech watches. His timepieces use the most advanced materials, some never before seen in the watch world, and highly sophisticated mechanics. Richard Mille insists that his brand ambassadors (tennis players, golfers, racecar drivers, and more) wear their watches in play – showcasing the fact that they can withstand any forces incurred. The Richard Mille collection runs the gamut from adventure watches, to dive watches and high complications – all with daring colors and three-dimensional architecture.;Richard Mille was born in the Var region in Draguignan, France, and attended the Besancon School of Technology. He started his career at a French watchmaking company and, after a few years, became Director of Export for all their wristwatches. By the 1990s, Richard Mille joined Mauboussin, of which he later became President of the watchmaking division. His position allowed him direct involvement in the creative process of watchmaking and access to future friends in the industry, such as movement crafter Audemars Piguet Renaud & Papi.\nAt the age of 50, Richard Mille had accumulated a wealth of knowledge and decided to go out on his own. He felt that no watch in existence at the time could ever really meet his expectations. Richard Mille aspired to advance watchmaking beyond anything that existed at the time. With a new contemporary approach to watchmaking, he planned to develop one product: the watch of his dreams without regard for what ended up being excessive production costs.\nHe approached his good friend Dominique Guenat, owner of Montres Valgine, to make his dream come true. The two men had met professionally when Richard Mille was at Mauboussin. They quickly struck up a friendship and agreed to be partners in Richard Mille, the brand. They both shared a passion for automobiles, aeronautics, and all things mechanical.;RichardMille/logo.svg
